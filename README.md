Common reminder i am dyslexic. i have spelling issues,

even if it looks like i can type perfectly fine. 

If you're interacting to cause drama / to hate on me or my boyfriend,

i will argue back before hiding you. i do not block/hide often, so

you must be real special to get me to hide you. Just saying.

Do interact, i love interaction! Unless it's to use our supporter title

to use for building. If i'm with our friends or not feeling well, i

will ignore you. (i'd ignore anyway). i do not like beggars, im sorry.

I hope you finish that build soon. :heart:
